# What's Happenin, Fam? I'm Karsten, and welcome to my Dope GitHub.

🪴 I'm building [@TheBrandChearis](https://www.chearis.org), a brand that exists solely for creators. Our motto is simple: craft creator culture. We believe that since everyone consumes that anyone can create. Come grow with us.

🏢 I'm a Senior Security Solutions Engineer in presales in the Cyber Threat Intelligence space. That's a fancy way of saying that I help organizations harden their security posture by successfully utilizing Tactical, Operational, and Strategic Threat Intelligence.
